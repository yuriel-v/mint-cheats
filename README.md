### Description
This is just a collection of scripts and other cheat sheets I'll be accumulating during my days as a Linux user. Nothing fancy here.

### Current scripts
- **essentials.sh**: A fresh install script to pull in some essential goodies. Root mode.
- **xbox-controller-fix.sh**: So it turns out my USB Xbox controller was identified as a PS3 controller... weird. We fixed that with this.
