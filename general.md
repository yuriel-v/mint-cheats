# General cheat sheet

This contains assorted cheats and good-to-knows that I found over time.

- **Screenshot keybind**
  - Go to keyboard > shortcuts > system > screenshots and recording
  - Edit "Copy a screenshot of an area to clipboard"
  - Note, if trying to replicate Windows functionality (super+shift+S), make sure to **change the shortcut on the Sound applet!**
  - To do so, right-click Sound > Configure... > Edit "Show menu" keybind
